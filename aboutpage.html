            Ocean is the reason that makes earth unique. 
            With covering 71% of the earth's surface, ocean is the largest ecosystem on earth, determines the main color tone of Earth's blue. 
            It is the home of millions of species and the origin of all life, The resources it produce nourish the life of land and sea. 
            However, Human activities and other factors pose a threat to the ocean, such as pollution, overfishing, and climate change. 
            These problems are threatening the health of our ocean and the survival of marine species. 
            And these consequences will ultimately have an impact on human beings.
            So, protect the ocean, protect the earth, protect the human beings.

        <h2>Seafloor microplastic</h2>
        <p class="content">
            Microplastics are tiny pieces of plastic that are less than five millimeters long. 
            They are created when larger pieces of plastic break down into smaller and smaller pieces. 
            And they are the evidience of how human activities are affecting the ecosystem in the ocean.
        </p>

        <p class="content">
            Although microplastics are known to pervade the global seafloor, 
            the processes that control their dispersal and concentration in the deep sea remain largely unknown. 
            Here, we show that thermohaline-driven currents, which build extensive seafloor sediment accumulations, 
            can control the distribution of microplastics and create hotspots with the highest concentrations reported for any seafloor setting (190 pieces per 50 grams). 
            Previous studies propose that microplastics are transported to the seafloor by vertical settling from surface accumulations; 
            here, we demonstrate that the spatial distribution and ultimate fate of microplastics are strongly controlled by near-bed thermohaline currents (bottom currents). 
            These currents are known to supply oxygen and nutrients to deep-sea benthos, 
            suggesting that deep-sea biodiversity hotspots are also likely to be microplastic hotspots.

            The ocean comprises 99.8% of the habitable volume of our planet, yet its resources are not inexhaustible. 
            Around the world, the intensity, spatial reach, and technical capacity of fisheries have expanded enormously over the past half-century. 
            As a consequence, overfishing is unquestionably the primary threat to ocean biodiversity. 
            Even as the stock health of some managed and monitored fisheries improves, many exploited species go unmonitored, making it difficult to track the extinction of marine fish species. 
            The statistical approaches used to infer extinctions are typically based on time series of sightings data, which are difficult to obtain for wide-ranging species, particularly marine fishes. 
            As a consequence, marine extinctions have been overlooked, as many marine populations have been exploited to the point of collapse long before monitoring began.
