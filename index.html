        <h2>About Ocean Protection</h2>
        <p>
            Ocean is the reason that makes earth unique. 
            With covering 71% of the earth's surface, ocean is the largest ecosystem on earth, determines the main color tone of Earth's blue. 
            It is the home of millions of species and the origin of all life, The resources it produce nourish the life of land and sea. 
            However, Human activities and other factors pose a threat to the ocean, such as pollution, overfishing, and climate change. 
            These problems are threatening the health of our ocean and the survival of marine species. 
            And these consequences will ultimately have an impact on human beings.
            So, protect the ocean, protect the earth, protect the human beings.

        <h2>Issues</h2>
        <p>
            The ocean is facing threats caused by human activities, 
            which have been around for a long time and are difficult to achieve immediate improvement in a short period of time. 
            However, time cannot wait, The pollution of the ocean has become increasingly serious, and we must make changes.

                <h3>Plastic Pollution</h3>
                <p>
                    Most of these plastics are difficult to degrade and will exist in the form of microplastics for a long time in the ocean, 
                    which can cause irreversible damage to the marine ecological environment.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Overfishing</h3>
                <p>
                    Overfishing can lead to the endangerment of certain species of marine life, which can seriously damage existing ecosystems. 
                    In the most severe case, the entire marine ecosystem of the region will be gone forever.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Climate Change</h3>
                <p>
                    The main impact of climate change on the ocean is reflected in two aspects: rising sea levels and increasingly frequent extreme weather. 
                    What's even more frightening is that many processes of climate change are positive feedback processes rather than negative feedback processes, which means that this situation will not stop on its own, but will only worsen.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Pollutant Emissions</h3>
                <p>
                    Pollutant emissions can cause significant pollution to the offshore marine environment, and some pollutants are difficult to decompose through the ocean. 
                    These pollutants not only damage ecosystems, but also ultimately cause humans to swallow bitter fruits in the form of bioaccumulation

        <h2>Solutions</h2>
        <p>
            The marine ecological environment faces numerous problems, and solving these problems requires uniting all of us and making tremendous efforts. 
            Economic pressure and regional differences make cooperation challenging. 
            Despite the numerous difficulties, we believe that all of this will eventually be rewarded and protecting the ocean is worth it

                <h3>Reducing Plastic Pollution</h3>
                <p>
                    Governments and NGOs are advocating for reducing the use of non degradable plastic products in people's daily lives 
                    and instead use more degradable plastic products and other environmentally friendly materials
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Sustainable Fisheries</h3>
                <p>
                    Strengthen fisheries planning, develop sustainable fisheries, establish marine protected areas and lockdowns, ensure time for the recovery of fishery resources. 
                    Optimize the operational processes of large fishing vessels, establish regulations, and supervise them.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Mitigating Climate Change</h3>
                <p>
                    The process of mitigating climate change through reducing greenhouse gas emissions and other measures. 
                    We should support renewable energy and minimize the use of fossil fuels, and take advance protective measures to cope with increasingly frequent extreme weather events.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Pollution Control</h3>
                <p>
                    Conduct water quality testing on domestic and industrial sewage discharged into the sea. 
                    For domestic sewage, it is required to be treated by a sewage treatment plant and meet the standards before discharge. 
                    For industrial water, factories are allowed to solve their own water quality problems before being discharged into the sea. 
                    Regular inspections are conducted, and fines are imposed if any non-compliance occurs.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>International Cooperation</h3>
                <p>
                    The ocean accounts for 71% of the Earth's surface area, which means that what any single country can do is limited. 
                    We must unite, let go of disputes and prejudices between countries, and form international cooperation, in order to truly protect our oceans.
